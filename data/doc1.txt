Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information
retrieval with text generation to improve the factual accuracy of large
language models.

Traditional language models rely only on the knowledge stored in their
parameters, which can be outdated or incomplete. This often leads to
hallucinations, where the model generates information that sounds plausible
but is incorrect.

RAG addresses this problem by first retrieving relevant documents or text
chunks from an external knowledge source, such as a document collection or
database. These retrieved chunks are then provided to the language model
as additional context during generation.

By grounding the model’s responses in retrieved evidence, RAG reduces
hallucinations and allows the system to answer questions using up-to-date
or domain-specific information. This makes RAG particularly useful for
applications such as question answering, chatbots, and enterprise search.

A typical RAG pipeline consists of document chunking, embedding generation,
vector-based retrieval using similarity search, and conditional text
generation using a language model.
